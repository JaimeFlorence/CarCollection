- **Service History**: Real-time calculation rather than scheduled jobs
- **Date Display**: Using local timezone for user-friendly display

### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy and SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
