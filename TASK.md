## üì∏ OCR Receipt Scanning POC Results (January 10, 2025)

### Proof of Concept Completed
Tested OCR technology for extracting service information from Ferrari repair receipts.

#### 1. **Tesseract OCR Results**
- ‚úÖ Successfully extracted: dates, phone numbers, VIN, basic info
- ‚ùå Poor performance on: line items, costs breakdown, shop name
- ‚ùå Issues: text garbling, special characters, duplicate extractions
- **Verdict**: Not suitable for production use with receipts

#### 2. **Google Vision API Setup**
- Created integration script: `/backend/ocr_google_vision_poc.py`
- Much better accuracy expected for:
  - Table/line item extraction
  - Cost categorization (parts vs labor)
  - Shop information extraction
- **Requirements**: Google Cloud account, Vision API enabled, service account credentials
- **Cost**: Free for first 1,000 pages/month, then $1.50/1,000

#### 3. **Implementation Files Created**
- `/backend/ocr_receipt_poc.py` - Tesseract implementation
- `/backend/ocr_google_vision_poc.py` - Google Vision implementation
- `/backend/GOOGLE_VISION_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions
- `/backend/ocr_results.json` - Tesseract test results

#### 4. **Recommended Approach**
1. Use Google Vision API for better accuracy
2. Create review/correction UI before saving to database
3. Map extracted fields to ServiceHistory model:
   - Shop name ‚Üí shop
   - Invoice # ‚Üí invoice_number
   - Service date ‚Üí performed_date
   - Parts total ‚Üí parts_cost
   - Labor total ‚Üí labor_cost
   - Tax ‚Üí tax
   - Grand total ‚Üí cost

#### 5. **Future Enhancement Ideas**
- Support multiple receipt pages
- Auto-categorize common service items
- Learn shop-specific formats over time
- Batch upload multiple receipts
- Mobile app integration for photo capture

   - Ensured proper number conversion for cost fields
   
2. **Service Cost Tracking Bug** ‚úÖ
   - Added summary line item for total cost when no individual costs assigned
   - Prevents $0.00 entries when service schedule items are checked
   
3. **Database Corruption** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed Ferrari 355 service history data
   - Removed duplicate entries
   - Corrected cost breakdown calculations

4. **Test Suite Repairs** ‚úÖ

- No integration or E2E tests
- Limited API endpoint coverage

See "HIGH PRIORITY - Testing Suite Expansion" section above for detailed roadmap.
