  - Major service tracking (configurable interval, notifications, snooze)
- **Enhancements:**
  - Maintenance log/history per car
  - Customizable service types (e.g., brake fluid, tire rotation)
  - Integration with calendar apps (Google Calendar, iCal)

### C. Notifications
- **Features:**
  - SMS or Telegram for reminders and To-Do entry
  - Snooze functionality for notifications
- **Enhancements:**

  - Store repair/parts receipts (manual entry or scan/upload)
  - Searchable repair log per car
- **Enhancements:**
  - OCR for scanned receipts (auto-extract info)
  - Cost analysis (total spent per car, per year, etc.)

### F. Trip Journal
- **Features:**
  - Log trip details (date, mileage, destination, notes)
  - Track routes and destinations
  - Add photos from trips
  - Calculate trip statistics
- **Enhancements:**
  - Map integration for route tracking
  - Trip cost tracking (fuel, food, lodging)
  - Weather data for trip dates
  - Export trip logs

### G. Miscellaneous
- **Features:**
  - Store license plate and insurance info
  - Add photos of cars, documents, etc.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Document expiration reminders (insurance, registration)
  - VIN decoding for auto-filling car details

## 2. Technical Approach

### A. Backend (Python)
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI (modern, async, easy to use), Django (batteries-included, admin interface)
- **Database:** SQLite (simple), PostgreSQL (scalable)
- **APIs:** REST or GraphQL for frontend/mobile integration

### B. User Interface
- **Web App:** 
  - **Frameworks:** React (most popular), Vue, or Svelte for frontend; can use Python backend
  - **Python UI:** Streamlit or Dash (easy, but less customizable for complex UIs)
- **Mobile:**
  - **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Works on any device, installable from browser
  - **Native App:** More complex, but can use frameworks like React Native or Flutter
- **Chatbot Integration:**
  - **Telegram Bot:** Python libraries (python-telegram-bot) for To-Do entry, notifications
  - **SMS:** Twilio API for sending/receiving texts

### C. File & Photo Storage
- **Local:** Store on disk (simple, but less portable) - **Preferred approach**
- **Cloud:** AWS S3, Google Drive, etc. (for scalability and backup)

### D. Authentication & Security
- User accounts, password management, possibly OAuth (Google, Apple, etc.)

## 3. Example User Flows

- **Add To-Do via Telegram:** User sends "Add oil change for Ferrari" to bot → Bot adds to Ferrari's To-Do list.
- **Receive Maintenance Reminder:** App sends SMS/Telegram "Annual service due for Porsche in 2 weeks. Snooze?"
- **Log Fuel Stop:** User enters "Filled 12.3 gallons, 34567 miles" via mobile app or Telegram.
- **Upload Repair Receipt:** User snaps photo in app, adds description, and it's stored with car's repair history.

## 4. Next Steps

1. **All features included** - No MVP prioritization needed, build the full product
2. **Choose Tech Stack:** Are you interested in learning a frontend framework, or would you prefer to focus on Python and use something like Streamlit or a chatbot interface?
3. **Design Data Model:** What info do you want to store for each car, issue, service, etc.?
   - **Car Entity:** Year, Make, Model, VIN, Mileage, Service History, Maintenance Schedule, Reminders, Pictures (potentially lots)
4. **Sketch UI:** Even rough wireframes help clarify what you want.
